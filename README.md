Data points provided include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries. You can collect other publicly available data to use in your model predictions, but in the spirit of this competition, use only data that would have been available before a movie's release.

Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Logarithmic-Error (RMSLE) between the predicted value and the actual revenue. Logs are taken to not overweight blockbuster revenue movies.
